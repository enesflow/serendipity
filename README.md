### What is Serendipity?

Serendipity is a Chrome extension designed to inject a little randomness and fun into your daily browsing. It occasionally changes the links on the pages you visit to take you somewhere unexpected — a random Wikipedia article, a quirky web toy, or a fascinating fact. The goal: help you break out of your routine and discover something new, every day.

### Features

- **Random Link Redirection:** Replaces a configurable percentage of links on any page with links to random, interesting, or whimsical sites.
- **Customizable Frequency:** Use the popup to set how often links are changed (e.g., 1 in 10, 1 in 50, etc.).
- **Editable Target List:** Add, remove, or restore default destinations for your serendipitous journeys.
- **Beautiful UI:** Clean, modern popup for easy configuration.
